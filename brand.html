        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Cy's Computers strives to provide excellenet technical support and
          stellar customer service to clients. I want to start this company out of love for technology, as well as a passion for continued learning. 
          Once I started working as an IT intern, I discovered the talent I had for connecting with people and troubleshooting their technical problems. 
          I realized that technical knowledge alone doesn't make a good IT professional; soft skills are often overlooked and are just as, if not more important. 
          I want to use my skills in customer service and my technical expertise to create Cy's Computer's, a computer repair company that aims for the clouds, and nothing less.
